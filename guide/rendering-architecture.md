This document describes the production rendering path at the `2c73092a` baseline and the
performance migration applied on `develop` in July 2026, with the September 2026 loading changes
reflected in the execution contract. Dated measurements remain historical snapshots. A new
feature should be placed in the latest possible loading phase that still preserves its first
interaction.

## Stack reality

The current application is Astro SSG with Material Web/Lit custom elements and native modules.
It contains no Angular runtime, Astro `client:*` island, Analog adapter, or PhotoSwipe package.
The image preview is the repository's own Material `md-dialog` implementation. Consequently,
the relevant mismatch risk is a custom element being used before upgrade, rather than an
Angular/Astro hydration mismatch.

The post `/posts/markdown-style-guide/` was deliberately deleted by the baseline commit and
replaced as a rendering fixture by `/posts/mdx-smoke-test/`. The migration preserves that route
state and tests the equivalent image-preview behavior on the replacement fixture.

| CSP/Vercel              | CSP hashes and headers are generated from the built HTML                          | No runtime policy relaxation                                                                          | Pagefind Worker/WASM and approved external Giscus/IP origins                                                                                                               | Deployment checks gate alias promotion                             |

The consent banner precedes the header and content. After the inline pre-lock checks the stored
acknowledgement, a small inline script clones the explicit-content template when the page is
locked, before any module is needed. Its CSS is imported by the Astro banner and delivered as
cacheable external CSS. The bootstrap module adopts that same notice node and binds its actions;
the buttons stay hidden until their handlers and Material definitions are ready. Initial focus
waits for Material, and an early Tab does not cancel that pending focus. Saved consent is checked
again before adoption. Changing the inline script requires regenerating the production CSP hashes.

## Target invariants

1. Astro owns the first render. Custom elements enhance existing markup and never replace the
   page shell with client-rendered HTML.
2. A route loads only the Material registry it uses. Shared controls stay in `material-web.js`;
   search, home, tags, content and image preview have separate entries. Archive tables load the
   text-field registry in `material-web/tags.js`; only archives with more than ten posts load
   `material-web/tag-pagination.js`, using the same `hasPagination` condition as the select markup.
3. A deferred feature has a tiny loader that catches the first pointer or keyboard activation.
   Image preview passes the original target and focus intent directly to its controller, without
   redispatching an event. Search currently finishes its import and replays the requested open
   with one programmatic `button.click()`; focus and hover normally warm that chunk before a
   click.
4. Initializers may cache module imports, but must run again for every `astro:page-load` and new
   DOM. Failed dynamic imports reset their cache so a later interaction can retry.
5. Optional services are not merely prevented from calling their endpoint: their modules are not
   imported before consent. Revoking consent removes an unexecuted service script immediately or
   reloads once if a Speed Insights or Giscus script was inserted, so neither an executed nor an
   in-flight third-party runtime can survive the opt-out. `pageshow` and consent-storage changes
   resynchronize restored BFCache pages and other open tabs.
6. The browser owns pinch zoom and smart zoom. While magnified, the image preview exposes a native
   scroll container over its fitted image canvas: touch and trackpad gestures use browser scrolling,
   and mouse dragging changes that same container's scroll position. It does not implement wheel
   panning or inertia. `viewport.js` aligns the scrollable image area to the visual viewport.
   An inverse scale and matching canvas dimensions keep scroll units in screen pixels without
   changing the visible image size. Gallery/dismiss gestures resume near 100%
   (5% entry / 3% exit tolerance), after the native gesture cooldown.
7. Keyboard focus is cycled explicitly inside both preview dialogs so Safari does not depend on
   the user's full-keyboard-access preference. A focus move made during Material's opening motion
   wins over the later resolution of `show()` instead of being overwritten by autofocus.
8. Native file sharing is prepared after preview intent. The click selects exactly one native
   payload: the `File` when ready and supported, otherwise its URL. A non-cancellation failure
   falls back directly to the clipboard because Web Share consumes transient activation on its
   first invocation.
9. CSP and Vercel headers are checked from the exact minified production output.

## Implemented migration stages

### 1. Remove unconditional work

- Removed sequential Lit warm-up imports.
- Moved IP geolocation and Speed Insights behind their individual consent switches.
- Made individual Speed Insights revocation remove its script and reload once whenever it
  had been inserted, including while its response is still in flight.
- Made individual Giscus revocation stop the current document load, remove the Giscus
  script/iframe, reset its loading state and reload once whenever Giscus reached the document.
  Returning consent reloads comments when their separate opt-in is still stored.
- Moved the Konachan background/color path behind explicit-content acknowledgement.
- Made every runtime Konachan entry carry a validated source color and removed the browser
  extraction Worker, its controller and its synchronous fallback. Source extraction remains a
  build-time responsibility when the authoring manifest is refreshed.

### 2. Split route and interaction registries

- Extracted search and image-preview Material registries.
- Restored `md-select-option` to the content and archive pagination entries that own it.
- Selected code-block and complex-shortcode enhancement by rendered DOM.
- Deferred the search controller and full image-preview controller until user intent.
- Disabled Vite's JavaScript dependency preloads for deferred entries. Intent warming still starts
  the real native module graph, without duplicate `modulepreload` requests or WebKit warnings for
  already evaluated shared modules.

### 3. Harden the image preview

- Kept pinch and smart zoom native. Magnified touch/trackpad panning uses element scrolling, which
  also works when Safari's modal visual viewport cannot pan. Mouse dragging uses the same scroll
  container. Fresh mouse presses clear Safari's occasionally missing `gestureend` state.
- Resolve client coordinates from the native dialog geometry. The toolbar retains its original
  layout anchor instead of following viewport panning. Compensate only its native pinch scale to
  preserve screen size; regular page/text zoom remains unaffected.
- Use a single 82% scrim baseline with and without motion. Dismissal fades depend on image
  displacement, not the pointer's starting position, and reach zero when the image leaves view.
- Made initial and information-dialog focus deterministic, added an explicit Safari-safe Tab
  cycle, and guarded it against the asynchronous completion of Material's opening animation.
- Kept real Material icon/text buttons and local icons; unsupported fullscreen remains genuinely
  hidden on WebKit.
- Prepared a native `File` before the share action and preserved transient user activation.
- Reused the prefetched share `File` for displayed MIME/size metadata, retaining `HEAD` only as a
  fallback.
- Kept history, scroll locking/restoration, gallery reset, reduced motion and the toolbar radius
  motion: 16 px → half-height → 16 px (28 px desktop, 26 px mobile).

### 4. Align delivery gates

- Added desktop and iPhone-profile WebKit coverage for the image preview, search, consent,
  Giscus/content and code-block surfaces to the normal Playwright gate.
- Made `develop` pushes run the same build/header and Lighthouse jobs required by its ruleset.
- Synchronized the versioned `main` and `develop` rulesets with the live GitHub rules.
- Documented the obsolete/circular Vercel deployment-check configuration that leaves aliases
  waiting even after GitHub Actions succeeds.

## Measurements

The deterministic build measurements below come from `pnpm build` on July 25, 2026. Raw, gzip and
Brotli sizes are calculated file by file with Node's default zlib settings; they do not represent
a CDN's exact transfer encoding. Route totals include the minified HTML, including inline scripts,
plus directly referenced local scripts, stylesheets and preloads. Generated entry points are
resolved by their stable stem and module imports, not by a checked-in content hash.

### Deterministic final build budgets

| HTML route and direct initial assets |       Raw |     Gzip |   Brotli |
| ------------------------------------ | --------: | -------: | -------: |
| Home                                 |  97,262 B | 21,406 B | 18,524 B |
| Published article                    | 133,367 B | 30,667 B | 26,582 B |
| Cookies                              |  90,552 B | 20,468 B | 17,648 B |

Vercel now owns unknown-route responses. The site no longer generates a custom error document,
illustration, stylesheet or layout mode; its bundle budgets cover generated site routes only.

| Deployable surface                    |           Raw |          Gzip |        Brotli |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------: | ------------: | ------------: |
| Application JavaScript in `/_astro/`  |     653,287 B |     163,310 B |     142,268 B |
| CSS in `/_astro/`                     |     106,429 B |      21,422 B |      18,526 B |
| Pagefind, three consecutive builds    | 230,124–126 B | 168,489–492 B | 165,812–822 B |
| Largest JavaScript artifact           |      97,651 B |      24,279 B |      20,537 B |
| Deferred search module graph          |     254,350 B |      65,352 B |      57,756 B |
| Deferred image-preview module graph   |     110,474 B |      33,308 B |      29,186 B |
| Deferred Konachan graph and resources |     172,522 B |      78,633 B |      73,944 B |

The deferred rows recursively follow local generated-module references. The Konachan row also
includes the compact manifest and permanent 960 px landing image. These are deterministic
deployment-footprint guards, not browser request traces: shared chunks can overlap between rows,
already-cached modules are not subtracted, and Pagefind remains a separate budget. Unit tests
cover changed hashes, HTML inclusion, all three encodings, a compressed-size failure, Pagefind
and ambiguous generated entries. The thresholds in
`scripts/check-bundle-budget.mjs` retain practical headroom instead of tracking the current output
byte for byte.

The representative article route allows 144 KiB raw, 36 KiB gzip and 32 KiB Brotli,
including the attributes enabled only in Vercel production. These route budgets do
not add together the HTML of every published article. Pagefind's fixed JavaScript
and WebAssembly engine has its own budget; generated search metadata, indexes,
filters and article fragments are measured and reported separately without a
site-wide size ceiling. Publishing more articles can therefore grow the search
corpus without exhausting the engine budget. The browser's first-search budget
still checks the resources actually loaded for a search.

Local browser fonts have a separate 128 KiB budget in each encoding. The check follows local
font URLs in generated stylesheets and their CSS imports, and includes direct font preloads,
counting each file once. Recognized font extensions and binary signatures are required before a
preload is separated from the existing route totals; `as="font"` alone cannot bypass them.
The existing route thresholds remain unchanged. Fonts discovered through CSS were previously
outside those totals, so the separate guard makes font preloading comparable with CSS discovery
while also detecting growth in the complete declared font set, including faces not used by a
particular page. This is a deployment-size bound rather than an estimate of fonts actually fetched.

Non-bare pages preload one shared Roboto variable file and the Material Symbols subset using
the exact versioned URLs from their CSS faces. Roboto keeps separate 400 and 700 descriptors
pointing to that same file, preserving the previous CSS weight matching (including requests
for 500 and 600) while saving 11,332 bytes and one font request. Generation and verification
details are recorded in [the Roboto source note](../public/fonts/roboto-SOURCE.txt).

Roboto Mono stays CSS-discovered: its normal and italic files now contain the static 400 instance already exposed by the CSS, preserving glyphs, advances
and hinting while removing unused weight variations. Conversion details and hashes are recorded
in [the Roboto Mono source note](../public/fonts/roboto-mono-SOURCE.txt).

Local Astro preview sets `vite.preview.cors: false` while retaining the fixed
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://giscus.app` header. This removes Vite's unnecessary
`Vary: Origin` from invariant responses: WebKit otherwise downloads each font again when its
CSS request omits the Origin sent by the preload. In the September 7, 2026 isolated article
navigation with the Playwright routing fixture and a 4.1-second observation window, WebKit
went from six font requests and three unused-preload warnings to three requests and no warnings.
Chromium also made three requests without warnings; both engines loaded all three faces.
The production header policy is unchanged.

Since the September 2026 audit, `tests/e2e/site-performance-budget.spec.ts` also bounds actual
same-origin HTML/JS/CSS responses after application initialization, including automatic module
imports. It covers home, article and archive routes with fresh and saved consent, plus the first
search with its Pagefind index. Response bodies are recompressed with gzip for server-independent
comparison; images and fonts remain outside this particular guard. JSON attachments retain each
resource and its size. Lighthouse now covers all three routes on mobile and desktop.

Test builds inject archive fixtures with 0, 1, 11 and 101 entries under `/__test__/archives/`.
These exercise the real Astro archive component and its browser pagination without changing the
published content or the search index. The normal build does not inject these routes.

The cold-route request counts in the following historical comparison came from isolated Chromium
contexts against one `astro preview` in the July 15 migration. Each scenario used a fresh browser
context with its normal cold cache. Request counts include cache-backed request events. The
accepted-consent scenario deterministically fulfilled the single `ipapi.is` request with the same
fixture as Playwright; no external response time or byte count was included in the local
JavaScript totals.

### Cacheable CSS delivery

The July 15 follow-up changed Astro from `inlineStylesheets: "always"` to `"never"` and moved
home, post and cookies styles out of the shared entry. This preserves render-blocking CSS but
lets hashed `/_astro/*` files use the existing one-year immutable cache.

| Production output across six HTML pages |    Before |     After | Change |
| --------------------------------------- | --------: | --------: | -----: |
| HTML bytes                              | 742,801 B | 175,460 B | −76.4% |
| Six-route traversal with CSS cache      | 742,801 B | 278,927 B | −62.5% |
| Shared CSS                              |  93,495 B |  45,533 B | −51.3% |

That July build had seven hashed stylesheets. `inlineStylesheets: "never"` controls Astro's bundled CSS
delivery; it is not a blanket assertion that component markup or runtime code never uses an
inline style attribute. Its initial CSS was 61,164 B on home and 52,598 B on cookies,
79,764 B on a post and 49,243 B on tags. A standalone `pnpm test:e2e` still builds its own
production output; `verify:quality` sets
`PLAYWRIGHT_REUSE_BUILD=1` after its explicit build so Playwright serves the validated `dist`
instead of compiling it a second time.

### Initial-route comparison

| Route/state                         | Baseline requests / JS / JS gzip | Migrated requests / JS / JS gzip |                          Change |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------: | -------------------------------: | ------------------------------: |
| Home, fresh explicit-content notice |              43 / 38 / 127,860 B |               38 / 31 / 69,181 B | −5 requests, −7 JS, −45.9% gzip |
| Cookies, functionality refused      |               41 / 35 / 92,346 B |               37 / 28 / 60,698 B | −4 requests, −7 JS, −34.3% gzip |
| Technical MDX post, Giscus refused  |              46 / 40 / 119,025 B |               41 / 32 / 68,087 B | −5 requests, −8 JS, −42.8% gzip |

The baseline tags route was 40 requests, 35 scripts and 96,938 B gzip. It was not captured in
the final isolated snapshot, so this document does not claim an unmeasured route-specific gain.

The fresh-home reduction is the primary initial-load result:

| Fresh home      | JavaScript modules |            Raw |          Gzip |
| --------------- | -----------------: | -------------: | ------------: |
| Baseline        |                 38 |      499,695 B |     127,860 B |
| Migrated        |                 31 |      241,560 B |      69,181 B |
| Absolute change |             **−7** | **−258,135 B** | **−58,679 B** |
| Relative change |         **−18.4%** |     **−51.7%** |    **−45.9%** |

### Final route and consent states

| Scenario                                                | Requests |  JS |    Raw JS |  Gzip JS |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------: | --: | --------: | -------: |
| Home, fresh explicit-content notice                     |       38 |  31 | 241,560 B | 69,181 B |
| Home, explicit content acknowledged and cookies refused |       42 |  33 | 354,753 B | 98,465 B |
| `/cookies/`, functionality refused                      |       37 |  28 | 202,436 B | 60,698 B |
| MDX article, functionality refused                      |       41 |  32 | 223,955 B | 68,087 B |
| Shortcode article, functionality refused                |       47 |  38 | 351,802 B | 92,617 B |

Moving from the fresh home notice to acknowledged explicit content adds four request events, two
JavaScript modules, 113,193 B raw and 29,284 B gzip. The compact runtime manifest carries the
precomputed Material source color. Runtime manifest version 2 rejects missing or malformed colors,
and incomplete local caches are discarded and replaced from that manifest. There is no longer a
browser extraction fallback or Worker artifact. The pre-acknowledgement boundary still blocks both
the controller and image network work rather than merely hiding the result.

The individually accepted home path was not part of this refreshed route snapshot. Its contract
remains unchanged: IP geolocation and Speed Insights stay behind their own consent switches, and a
local preview does not activate Speed Insights without Vercel's production marker.

### Pagefind first-use path

Measured from `/cookies/` with functionality refused:

| Phase                                                            | Added requests |           Raw |          Gzip |        Brotli |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------: | ------------: | ------------: | ------------: |
| Focus search trigger: controller only                            |              1 |      18,130 B |       5,546 B |       4,985 B |
| Open search: Material controls, Pagefind worker/runtime and WASM |             13 |     290,420 B |     123,177 B |     117,487 B |
| First query: one index and one result fragment                   |              2 |         249 B |         292 B |         257 B |
| **Initial route to first query**                                 |         **16** | **308,799 B** | **129,015 B** | **122,729 B** |

The opening phase consists of 130,373 B raw / 24,964 B gzip / 21,843 B Brotli of Material
Search, 87,003 B / 25,125 B / 22,632 B of Pagefind JavaScript, and 73,044 B / 73,088 B / 73,012
B of entry metadata and WASM. The 72,782 B French WASM is effectively incompressible.

The first query uses Pagefind's internal placeholder term to exercise both generated index files;
the two unlisted posts are intentionally absent from the public index. The baseline opening path
added 7 requests, 176,044 B raw and 101,392 B gzip. The migrated initial-to-first-query path adds
9 more requests, 132,755 B raw and 27,623 B gzip, but it includes focus warm-up, the lazily split
Material registry and an actual query, so it is not a strict like-for-like regression. The
measurable trade-off is deliberate: none of that cost remains on the closed initial route, at the
expense of a more fragmented first use.

### Image-preview first-use path

The MDX article initially loads the capture-phase loader, not the complete controller. A cold
first click adds three JavaScript requests:

| Chunk              |          Raw |         Gzip |
| ------------------ | -----------: | -----------: |
| `image-preview`    |     39,120 B |      9,889 B |
| Material dialog    |     13,292 B |      3,853 B |
| Clipboard fallback |        962 B |        538 B |
| **Total**          | **53,374 B** | **14,280 B** |

The three chunks total 12,528 B Brotli. Initial article JavaScript plus a first opening is
285,782 B raw and 83,240 B gzip, still 201,673 B raw (−41.4%) and 35,785 B gzip (−30.1%) below
the baseline post's initial JavaScript.

A cold open trace contained six network events: the three chunks, the same WebP in two image
request events, and one fetch through `prepareShareFile()`. Request events include cache-backed
loads, so this count does not prove three independent wire transfers. The prepared file's MIME
and size are reused by the information dialog, avoiding the otherwise redundant `HEAD`; that
request remains only as a fallback when file preparation fails. Preparing the share `File` at
preview intent preserves Safari's transient user activation later, but it also pulls the full
image before the information panel or share action is used. Deferring that work without losing
native file sharing remains explicit debt.

### Total generated JavaScript

| Production `_astro` output     | Artifacts |        Raw |      Gzip |    Brotli |
| ------------------------------ | --------: | ---------: | --------: | --------: |
| Before mandatory source colors |        62 |  779,216 B | 189,962 B | 164,444 B |
| Final                          |        58 |  653,287 B | 163,310 B | 142,268 B |
| Change                         |        −4 | −125,929 B | −26,652 B | −22,176 B |

The three removed extraction artifacts represented 116,820 B raw, 23,774 B gzip and 19,677 B
Brotli. Dead-code elimination and the resulting chunk regrouping account for the rest of the
16.2% raw, 14.0% gzip and 13.5% Brotli reduction. `@material/material-color-utilities` remains
required: the browser creates the light/dark Material schemes from the validated `sourceColor`,
and the refresh script computes that color from image pixels at build/maintenance time.

### Lighthouse mobile snapshot

Migrated ranges below come from the three final simulated-mobile JSON reports emitted by the
release gate, rather than selecting one favorable run.

| Metric             |       Baseline | Final migrated range |             Change |
| ------------------ | -------------: | -------------------: | -----------------: |
| Performance        |            100 |                  100 |          No change |
| Requests           |             44 |                   36 |                 −8 |
| Total transferred  |      224,668 B |            166,480 B | −58,188 B (−25.9%) |
| JS requests        |             38 |                   30 |                 −8 |
| JS transferred     |      144,587 B |             86,333 B | −58,254 B (−40.3%) |
| FCP                | 1,352–1,353 ms |       1,427–1,429 ms |          +74–77 ms |
| LCP                | 1,427–1,428 ms |       1,502–1,504 ms |          +74–77 ms |
| TBT                |       11–14 ms |               0–3 ms |      8–14 ms lower |
| CLS                |         0.0083 |               0.0083 |          No change |
| JavaScript boot-up |   Not recorded |             18–70 ms |                  — |

The final gate completed three mobile and three desktop runs; all six scored 100 for performance,
accessibility and best practices. The byte reduction is stable across the three mobile reports,
but their LCP remains roughly 74–77 ms slower than the baseline range and is reported explicitly.
The final desktop range was FCP 343–344 ms, LCP 363–364 ms and TBT 0 ms, compared with baseline
FCP 322–324 ms, LCP 362–364 ms and TBT 0 ms. Lighthouse does not exercise acknowledged Konachan,
Pagefind, Giscus or image-preview interactions, so those paths remain Playwright/browser checks.

## Verification contract

- `pnpm verify:project`: unit/theme/type/lint/audit/symbol/Knip/format, production build,
  CSP/headers, all Playwright projects, then three mobile and three desktop Lighthouse runs.
- `pnpm build:vercel`: complete history reachable from `HEAD`, Astro SSG, Pagefind, minification
  and final CSP/header validation. A non-shallow checkout performs no fetch. A shallow detached
  Vercel checkout fetches only `refs/heads/$VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF`, or the exact `HEAD` SHA when
  that branch is unavailable; tags and unrelated branches are not downloaded. Unit fixtures
  verify shallow clones, detached commits, `git log --follow` across a rename and a non-blocking
  remote failure.
- `Nightly cross-browser QA`: eight conditional desktop/mobile and light/dark profiles, but not
  eight complete-suite runs. The four Firefox profiles target image-preview and resilience specs;
  the four WebKit profiles run the complete suite. The gate allows one retry maximum with
  `--fail-on-flaky-tests`, retains traces/screenshots/videos and adds a single-worker repeated
  WebKit pass over image preview, consent, Giscus and search.
- Nightly resilience checks also fail on runtime/console/CSP/unhandled-rejection/request failures
  and exercise corrupt storage, offline recovery, deterministic slow network, BFCache restore and
  portrait/landscape transitions.
- Image preview: Chromium light/dark desktop/mobile plus targeted light WebKit desktop/mobile;
  first activation, toolbar visible/hidden/visible, mouse/touch/trackpad gestures, history,
  scroll, post-animation focus, 16 px/pill/16 px radius motion, native file share,
  URL/clipboard fallback, transient fullscreen/share activation and console cleanliness. WebKit
  additionally simulates DPR changes and `gesturestart`/`gestureend`, verifies that zoomed pointer,
  wheel and double-click events remain native, and checks that inter-image navigation is suspended
  then restored.
- In-app browser inspection: desktop 1280 px rendering, physical keyboard flow and first-click
  lazy loading. Mobile rendering and interactions use the Chromium/WebKit device profiles above.

## Known trade-offs and debt

- Playwright WebKit is a Safari-engine approximation, not a physical iPhone or the installed
  macOS Safari application. Native pinch and the system share sheet still need a physical-device
  release smoke test.
- Automated visual checks assert layout, visibility, state and focus rather than stored pixel
  snapshots. They protect the rendered contract across desktop/mobile profiles, but exact
  device-pixel parity on macOS and iPhone Safari still belongs in that physical release smoke.
- Browser-zoom automation uses Chromium CDP. WebKit simulates the DPR/gesture signal and verifies
  the native touch handoff plus the absence of custom transforms or canceled events, but Playwright
  cannot drive Safari's actual zoom UI, physical pinch gesture, smart-zoom reset or system share
  sheet.
- The cold preview trace records two WebP image request events and a separate share-file fetch.
  Some image events can be cache-backed, but the share prefetch can still transfer the full file.
  It is the current cost of keeping Safari's native file share inside transient user activation
  and should be reduced only with a physical-Safari proof.
- Revoking consent after a Speed Insights or Giscus script was inserted reloads the page once,
  because removing an in-flight dynamic script does not reliably prevent Chromium from executing
  it and removing a loaded script cannot undo third-party code. This can discard transient UI
  state, and an IP request that already completed cannot be retroactively cancelled.
- Deferred search/image-preview chunks can add latency to a first interaction; focus and hover
  prewarming mitigate it. Preview uses a tested direct controller handoff; search currently
  replays a cold open with one programmatic `button.click()`, whose trusted-event semantics
  remain a difference to keep covered. Dependency preloading is intentionally disabled, so a cold
  activation follows the native import graph instead of issuing speculative shared-module
  requests.
- Disabling module preloads relies on a Vite `generateBundle` hook mutating
  `this.environment.config.build.modulePreload`. It is verified with Astro 7 and Vite 8, but that
  environment configuration API must be revalidated when either tool is upgraded.
- Search first use is more fragmented than the baseline path: the measured initial-to-query path
  adds 9 requests and 27,623 B gzip over the older opening-only trace. The benefit is the complete
  removal of this work from routes where search stays closed.
- Code splitting still trades additional first-interaction requests for a smaller closed route,
  but mandatory Konachan source colors now remove four deployable artifacts and 26,652 B gzip
  compared with the immediately preceding build.
- All three final mobile Lighthouse runs scored 100, but their LCP remained 74–77 ms slower than
  the baseline range. A perfect aggregate score therefore does not erase the timing regression.
- Extracted, hashed CSS adds render-blocking stylesheet requests on a cold route. The trade-off is
  deliberate: route-specific styles no longer inflate every document, and shared styles are
  reused from the immutable browser cache on subsequent navigation. Keep the per-route imports and
  verify the generated external stylesheet links when changing Astro or Vite; the configuration
  value alone is not a general no-inline-style assertion.
- Consent CSS now participates in initial stylesheet loading even when consent is already stored.
  This lets the first-visit notice render before the module graph and reuses the immutable CSS
  cache on later visits; the controller no longer carries and injects that stylesheet.
- The current build contains only two unlisted technical posts, so the Pagefind index is nearly
  empty and its search measurements are not representative of a production corpus.
- Deterministic archive fixtures cover table filtering, sorting and pagination through 101 posts.
  List-view tag pagination above ten posts still lacks a rendered browser fixture; its select
  registry uses the same `hasPagination` condition as the tested table view.
- The Konachan set dominates `dist` (300 WebP files, 23,727,528 B, or 22.6 MiB), but its runtime
  manifest, controller and chosen images are outside the fresh initial path. The browser reads the
  compact runtime manifest rather than the authoring manifest; every version 2 entry must contain
  a valid source color, so no browser color Worker is emitted. The 960/1920 variant is selected
  against the full `background-size: cover` geometry (width, height and source aspect ratio)
  multiplied by DPR.
- Dependabot applies a one-day version cooldown to match pnpm 11's 1,440-minute minimum release
  age. Without it, a fresh automated version PR can be impossible for CI and Vercel to install
  until the package matures; Dependabot security updates remain outside the cooldown.
- Dependabot temporarily ignores semver-major TypeScript updates: `@astrojs/check@0.9.9`
  supports TypeScript 5 and 6, while its current language server crashes during `astro check` on
  TypeScript 7. Patch/minor 6.x and security updates remain enabled; remove the exception once
  Astro's declared peer range and check runtime support TypeScript 7.
- Dependabot also defers the semver-major `@types/node` line until the runtime baseline moves from
  Node 22 to Node 26. The ESLint 10 majors (`eslint`, `@eslint/js` and `eslint-plugin-astro`) stay
  deferred until the project can migrate them together and `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` supports
  ESLint 10. Their patch, minor and security update lanes remain enabled.
- The Vercel GitHub status already stuck on `Waiting for checks to complete` cannot be repaired by
  repository code alone. The obsolete check must be removed in the authenticated Vercel project,
  then the deployment must be recreated.
- The preview smoke intentionally has no bypass credential, so a deployment protected by Vercel
  Authentication remains unverified rather than being reported as a skip or success. Enabling it
  safely requires creating a project-scoped Protection Bypass for Automation secret, storing it
  as an encrypted GitHub Actions secret, and teaching both the HTTP probe and Playwright context
  to send `x-vercel-protection-bypass` only to the already validated preview origin. Browser
  follow-up requests also require `x-vercel-set-bypass-cookie: true`. No secret, repository
  variable or Vercel project setting is created by this change; see
  [Vercel's official automation bypass documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection/protection-bypass-automation).
- The versioned rulesets mirror the live GitHub rules, including an `always` bypass for the `c2tz`
  administrator. This permits the requested direct integration push but means branch protections
  are not absolute against that account; removing it requires a deliberate live ruleset policy
  change, not a repository-only edit.
